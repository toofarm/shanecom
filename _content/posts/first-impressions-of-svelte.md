I had spent a year or so noting the increasing frequency with which [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) kept showing up in debates as to which frontend framework was "best". 

Already curious, [an article](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/javascript-frameworks-and-core-web-vitals-b5581f1c8962) comparing the Core Web Vitals performance of common frontend frameworks persuaded me to give Svelte a try. In this article, the author revealed that, according to Google's data on the subject, Svelte was wiping the floor with both React.js and Angular across all CWVs. SvelteKit, Svelte's server-side rendering library, performed even better.

My curiosity peaked, I decided to try using Svelte on a modest "Hello World"-type app, and see how it compared to React.js and VueJS - my two favorites presentation-layer frameworks to date.
