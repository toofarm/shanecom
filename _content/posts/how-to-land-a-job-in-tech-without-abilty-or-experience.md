This past week I read [Lowly Midwestern Engineer's article](https://lowlyswe.substack.com/p/my-experience-getting-a-tech-job) about finding a job in tech without any industry experience.

I sympathized with much of his narrative, and thought it would be interesting to share my thoughts on the same theme. There are no straight lines in nature and, for what it's worth, here's some info about the squiggly path that led me to where I am.

## Life before tech

For nearly a decade after graduating from college, I wandered around working a series of ignominious jobs that had little or nothing to do with technology. I was trying to be a journalist, and spent large amounts of time writing for alt weeklies, magazines, and digital news startups.

Since this work was intermittent and low-paying, I often had to supplement my income by taking on side gigs. I wrote descriptions of fiber optic products, worked as an incredibly ineffective mover, and, for a brief spell, made lattes and smoothies at a coffee bar embedded in a Williamsburg, Brooklyn Whole Foods.

My biggest scoop as a journalist came when I discovered that the economics of the job I was pursuing were no longer viable.

Broke and disappointed, I demurred to the reality that I would be happier doing something else.

## Faking it until you make it

I decided to pursue a programming career with the barest minimum of knowledge about what I was getting into.

In college, I had taken an introductory class on web development. This class covered HTML and CSS, then spent a single day introducing Javascript, which the instructor implied was an optional embellishment.

I enjoyed the class. The process of building something and seeing it pop up on my computer monitor was rewarding, as was the air, still novel at that point, of being a secular wizard, capable of unlocking the secrets of technologies popularly regarded  as baffling.

Later, I worked as a reporter for a digital news startup in Bangkok (that's another blog post), where I sat close to several web developers and overheard them talking about the work involved in building a website.

This meager experience proved to be an asset, as it fixed me with the idea that programming was a) something I could do, and b) significantly easier than it in fact turned out to be.

With my journalism career coughing out its dying breaths, I spent a couple months working through Codeacademy.com courses and decided to commit to a career in tech by attending a bootcamp.

## Bootcamps for better and worse

Bootcamps have sullied their reputation over the past five years by trying to con students with unrealistic expectations, and employers with half-baked students. Nevertheless, I am convinced I would not be a developer were it not for coding bootcamps, and I have no regrets about attending one.

There is a popular belief among developers that you can teach yourself
