Last week, the Burning Glass Institute's [report on AI and the workplace](https://www.burningglassinstitute.org/research/generative-artificial-intelligence-and-the-workforce) became the latest of several such studies to sow a cycle of frightening headlines about the future of knowledge work.

_The New York Times_ provides the model here:

["Generative A.I.â€™s Biggest Impact Will Be in Banking and Tech, Report Says"](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/business/ai-impact-jobs.html)

"Banking and tech" forming a signifiant chunk of the _Times_' readership, I understand their focus here. But even if it's a fair summary of the Burning Glass Institute's work, I still think it neglects a much bigger issue raised by the report (and by similar think tanks that have conducted similar studies).

From page 12 of the report:

>Given the broad potential for human labor to be displaced by AI, increases in productivity will generate disproportionate returns for investors and senior employees at tech companies, many of whom are already among the wealthiest people in the U.S. Thus, the U.S. economy, already characterized by high levels of inequality, will see further economic stratification and increased concentration of wealth.

In other words, the rich stand to become exponentially richer, while the middle and lower classes stand to stagnate at best. More likely, I suspect, is that the not-rich will wind up trapped in a cycle of functional poverty, neither starving nor able to use their wits and effort to pursue wealth.

How, given a wealth gap of that magnitude, would our systems of government survive? The United States' economy is already so top-heavy it can barely stand. Pushing it to further extremes would seem to guarantee calamity.
