We began this project as a lark, but it came to define our entire company.

Also, I think I may have misunderstood how this content system works. The template provides a "body" element out of the box, rather than necessitating that you create one. 

Let's add some code:

    def double_me(num):
    	return num * 2

Now let's try **bolding some text.**

And another paragraph break for good measure. Before lead to a quote:
