This past week I read [Lowly Midwestern Engineer's article](https://lowlyswe.substack.com/p/my-experience-getting-a-tech-job) about finding a job in tech without any industry experience.

I sympathized with much of his narrative, and thought it would be interesting to share my thoughts on the same theme. There are no straight lines in nature and, for what it's worth, here's some info about the squiggly path that led me to where I am.

## Life before tech

For nearly a decade after graduating from college, I wandered around working a series of ignominious jobs that had little or nothing to do with technology. I was trying to be a journalist, and spent large amounts of time writing for alt weeklies, magazines, and digital news startups.

Since this work was intermittent and low-paying, I often had to supplement my income by taking on side gigs. I wrote descriptions of fiber optic products, worked as an incredibly ineffective mover, and, for a brief spell, made lattes and smoothies at a coffee bar embedded in a Williamsburg, Brooklyn Whole Foods.

My biggest scoop as a journalist came when I discovered that the economics of the job I was pursuing were no longer viable.

Broke and disappointed, I demurred to the reality that I would be happier doing something else.

## Faking it until you make it

I decided to pursue a programming career with the barest minimum of knowledge about what I was getting into.

In college, I had taken an introductory class on web development. This class covered HTML and CSS, then spent a single day introducing Javascript, which the instructor implied was an optional embellishment.

I enjoyed the class. The process of building something and seeing it pop up on my computer monitor was rewarding, as was the air, still novel at that point, of being a secular wizard, capable of unlocking the secrets of technologies popularly regarded  as baffling.

Later, I worked as a reporter for a digital news startup in Bangkok (that's another blog post), where I sat close to several web developers and overheard them talking about the work involved in building a website.

This meager experience proved to be an asset, as it fixed me with the idea that programming was a) something I could do, and b) significantly easier than it in fact turned out to be.

With my journalism career coughing out its dying breaths, I spent a couple months working through Codeacademy.com courses and decided to commit to a career in tech by attending a bootcamp.

## Bootcamps for better and worse

Bootcamps have sullied their reputation over the past five years by trying to con students with unrealistic expectations, and employers with half-baked students. Nevertheless, I am convinced I would not be a developer were it not for coding bootcamps, and I have no regrets about attending one.

There is a popular belief among developers that you can teach yourself all the skills needed to become a professional engineer. This is true, but with several large caveats:

Every self-taught developer who I know has had several advantages going into the process. For one, they are all left-brained people with a natural affinity for processes and abstractions. These are the people who taught themselves shell scripting during high school and refer to calculus as "easy".

Also, these individuals have taught themselves to program during stretches of life during which they have few financial obligations and an excess of free time. Whether that means they were living with their parents, relying on a largess of a generous girlfriend, or cooling their heels with money they got off of the GI Bill, they were all in a position to spend 8+ hours per day hunched over their computers, trying to figure out how to configure a server.

I had neither the mental disposition nor the financial comfort to pursue the self-teaching route, so I sought out a bootcamp.

A word of advice: if you're going to attend a bootcamp, spend the smallest amount of money on it that you possibly can.

For-profit bootcamps will saddle you with as much as $17k in non-dischargable debt, which is crazy, especially when you consider another of my core theses:

### Upon completing a bootcamp, you will not be ready to work an actual programming job

Bootcamps are great starting points, but after graduating from a 3-month web development course, you're still  looking at 6-to-12 months worth of work before you're hireable. In total, I'd say it takes about a year to go from "not a developer" to "developer"; and that's a year in which your full-time, 40-hour-a-week occupation is learning to code.

I didn't know this going in, so it was pure luck that led me to choose the [Full Stack Web Development program at CUNY Brooklyn](https://cuny-catalog.skillstorm.com/courses/cuny-full-stack-java-development) over a number of pricier bootcamps. 

The program at CUNY provided a less robust background than some of the private bootcamps, but its sticker price was $2,500, whereas [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/portland) was around that time charging $13,000 for its fullstack course. 

To my mind, the biggest advantage of attending a bootcamp is having someone around who can help you get past the brick-wall frustrations you run into as a junior developer. I'm certain that had I not attended a bootcamp, I would have given up on web development completely when I got to server-side scripting. Instead, a jovial man in a Hawaiian shirt helped explain to me that PHP executes on a different machine than Javascript, and with that advice I was able to proceed.

Before moving on from bootcamps, it's important to mention a couple things that made the process worthwhile for me. For one, I _worked_ while attending that class. Not only did I do weeks worth of prep work, but I pushed myself to turn in ridiculously ambitious projects during the course. The hours I spent working on those projects meant that I came out of the course with more knowledge than I otherwise might have. 

I was also ready to continue working after I graduated. This is a result of my personality, but I held myself to a comically high standard when starting out, and pushed myself to keep working until my projects resembled something professional.

Success, in software development as in many things, is more often a result of effort than of talent.

## Actually getting a job

Since I had never worked in tech, I concocted a scheme to use my existing skills as a bridge into the industry.

This plan worked pretty well. Shortly after graduating from the bootcamp, I was offered a job with a publishing house that consisted of 50% content writing and 50% development on a couple of Wordpress sites. 

The publishing house, I soon discovered, had entered dire financial straits; a sale was eminent. Working for a failing company, however, turned out to be a great deal. Management gave me free reign to pursue whichever kinds of development projects I pleased, and when the ship sank at last, I received a sizeable "sorry for giving you the sack" bonus, which kept me happy and healthy while I traded up into a full-time development job.

Though the journey since has involved a couple twists, it's fair to summarize the trajectory as upward-facing, with each chapter bringing more complex technical responsibilities and more Scrooge McDuck-ian amounts of compensation. 

Once you're in, as they say, you're in.

## The secret of my success

Both in my bootcamp cohort and amongst my acquaintances, I've seen people struggle to find development jobs, or else wash out of the industry entirely. My success vis-a-vie their difficulty owes in my opinion to several factors, technical talent not being among them.

If there's a single reason why I've been able to build myself a career as a developer (such as it is), it's because I enjoy the process of making things with code. Banging my head for hours against a difficult coding problem, then breaking through that difficulty, is intensely satisfying to me. I can spend 6 or 8 or 10 hours working in this mode and feel good about it at the end of the day.

I consider myself more or less bereft of technical talent. Programming has never been intuitive for me, nor has any other activety involving high levels of abstraction. In high school, I barely passed trigonometry and bowed out of calculus entirely; I majored in English Literature in college, satisfying my school's STEM requirement by taking Intro to Statistics and passing based on the strength of an essay I turned in for extra credit.

That I have had meager success as a software engineer owes largely to the fact that I enjoy doing it. 

Making little machines out of logic puzzles is intensely satisfying to me. My drive to make those machines function smoothly borders at times on compulsive.

Because I derive so much enjoyment from writing software, I've spent a huge number of hours doing so, and, despite myself, become kind of good at it. 

I'm not among the world's programming elite, and I never will be. In order to develop remarkable talent, you have to start when you're a teenager and your brain is still squishy. I began programming in earnest shortly before I turned 30, and suffered from the natural handicap of mind that thinks foremost in stories and feelings. However, with moderate intelligence, loads of tenacity, and propitious economic circumstances I've managed to make it work for me.
