Last week, the Burning Glass Institute's [report on AI and the workplace](https://www.burningglassinstitute.org/research/generative-artificial-intelligence-and-the-workforce) became the latest of several such studies to prompt a cycle of frightening headlines about the future of knowledge work.

_The New York Times_ provides the model here:

["Generative A.I.â€™s Biggest Impact Will Be in Banking and Tech, Report Says"](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/business/ai-impact-jobs.html)

I suspect "banking and tech" forms a signifiant chunk of the _Times_' readership, and the choice of headline follows. However, framing this debate in terms of "which jobs will survive?" masks a much large issue.

From page 12 of the report:

>Given the broad potential for human labor to be displaced by AI, increases in productivity will generate disproportionate returns for investors and senior employees at tech companies, many of whom are already among the wealthiest people in the U.S. Thus, the U.S. economy, already characterized by high levels of inequality, will see further economic stratification and increased concentration of wealth.

In other words, those with the most financial means at present stand to reap the majority of the economic rewards derived from generative AI. It will make the rich richer, while the middle and lower classes stagnate at best. More likely, I suspect, is that the not-rich will wind up trapped in a cycle of functional poverty, neither starving nor able to use their wits and effort to pursue wealth.

How, given a wealth gap of that magnitude, would our systems of government survive? The United States' economy is already so top-heavy it can barely stand. Pushing it to further extremes would seem to court calamity.
