I'm a software engineer who focuses on front-end development. Right now, I work as a full-stack dev for [Theo Agency ](https://theo.agency/) in Portland, Oregon.

Take a look around to get a feel for the kinds of projects I work on. You can also find free-ranging thoughts on software, work and anything else that crosses my mind.

I'm sure we'll be fast friends.
