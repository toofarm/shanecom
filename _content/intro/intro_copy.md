I'm a software engineer who focuses on data engineering and fullstack application development. Right now, I work as a fullstack engineer for [Theo Agency](https://theo.agency/) in Portland, Oregon.

Take a look around to get a feel for the kinds of projects I work on. You can also find free-ranging thoughts on software, books and whatever else crosses my mind.

Glad to meet you; I'm sure we'll be fast friends.
