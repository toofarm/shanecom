A personal CMS

Bootstrapped via Next.js, content managed via TinaCMS (formerly Forestry.io)

## Project structure

All site content types lives in `_content`. This directory contains markdown files, which adhere to a data taxonomy laid out in TinaCMS.

At build time, Next.js converts the markdown files to HTML and uses SSG to generate application routes.
