This past week I read [Lowly Midwestern Engineer's article](https://lowlyswe.substack.com/p/my-experience-getting-a-tech-job) about finding a job in tech without any industry experience. 

I sympathize with much of what he mentions, and thought it would be interesting to share my thoughts on the same theme. Listening to other people's stories about their careers forms an endless point of fascination for me, and I hope someone out there will find something useful in my own story.

## Life before tech 

For nearly a decade after graduating from college, I wandered around working a series of ignominious jobs that had little or nothing to do with tech. I wanted to be a journalist, and spent large amounts of time writing for alt weeklies, magazines, and digital news startups.

Since this work was intermittent and low-paying, I often had to supplement my income by taking on side gigs. I wrote descriptions of fiber optic products, worked as an incredibly ineffective mover, and, for a brief spell, made lattes and smoothies at a coffee bar embedded in a Brooklyn Whole Foods. 

I hesitate to call my work in journalism a "career", since I spent the most of my time skulking around the industry's edges. My biggest scoop as a journalist came when I discovered that the economics of the job I was pursuing were no longer viable.

Broke and disappointed, I demurred to the reality that I would be happier pursuing something else.

## Faking it until you make it

I decided to pursue a programming career with the barest minimum of knowledge about what I was getting into.

In college, I had taken an introductory class on web development. This class covered HTML and CSS, then spent a single day introducing Javascript, and called it good . 

Later, I had worked as a reporter for a digital news startup in Bangkok (that's another blog post), where I sat close to several web developers and overheard them talking about the work involved in building a website.

This meager experience proved to be an asset, as it fixed me with the idea that programming was a) something I could do, and b) significantly easier than it in fact turned out to be.
